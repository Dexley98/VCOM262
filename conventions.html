        <h2 id="top">Fur from "Conventional"</h2>
        <p>Coupled with the strong presence of online forums and social media, furry conventions have grown considerably. Anthrocon, which is held in Pittsburgh is now considered the largest furry convention, bringing in 7,308 attendees in 2016. Conventions now have become large social gatherings for thousands of furries from around the world. For many, these occasions serve as the main opportunity to wear fursuits and act out their fursonas.</p>
        <p>Philanthropy is a main component throughout not just furry conventions, but also many local furry groups as well. Charity fundraisers and non-profit causes have been continually utilized as a positive way to present the fandom to the general public. With charity work beginning at Anthrocon in its inaugural year, it has grown to be considered a main staple at every furry convention. The first Anthroconraised $2,200 dollars for Therapy Dogs/K9 Friends. Convention charity funds typically go to non-human animal related causes,such as humane societies, animal rescues, zoos and aviaries, military K9 placement programs, and pet therapy programs.</p>
        <h3>What do furries do at cons?</h3>
        <p>Convention programming includes presentations, panels, workshops and tutorials on anthropomorphic culture, from literature, fiction and art to science, technology and spirituality. The convention will often provide space for stand-up comedy routines by entertainers. A unifying theme is common for larger events.</p>
        <p>Most conventions will feature some kind of an art show, in which artists' work is displayed, often for direct purchase or auction during the convention. There will often be a "Dealers Den" where art and comic book distributors and other merchants can sell their wares for a fee, and an Artists' Alley where individual artists are given space for no fee or a token fee, usually on the condition that they only sell their own work. Artists may also trade art between each other using sketchbooks. Erotic art is typically allowed if kept separate from other pieces, and only shown to adult attendees; a few conventions are rated strictly PG-13. Individual transactions are relatively small (usually around $10–$50 for sketches or badges, $10–$200 for auction pieces), but the total can approach $100,000 at the largest events.</p>
        <p>Major conventions tend to have a rave on at least one evening. Often there is a "fursuit-friendly" dance prior to the main event, with raised lighting and slower music to offset fursuiters' reduced vision and mobility. The use of glowsticks and illuminated poi are popular once the lights are dimmed. A furry convention is also an oppurtunity to socialize, and private parties for subgroups of the fandom are common.</p>
        <p>Conventions with significant numbers of fursuiters may offer an event known as the furry games, furry races, or critterlympics. These focus on feats of dexterity suited to multiple players in teams, such as dragging a sled filled with plush toys or other fursuiters around a marked track, or racing back and forth while tethered to one another with a hula hoop.</p>
