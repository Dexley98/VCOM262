        <h2 id="top">The Fursuit</h2>
        <p>Fursuits are the most identifiable aspect of the fandom, even though only about 13% of furries polled actually owned a full fursuit, with around 25% saying they owned a partial fursuit</p>
        <p> Full fursuits, cover the complete body and encompass a body suit, head, hand paws, feet paws, and sometimes a tail, while a partial fursuit usually consists of a head, hand paws, and sometimes feet/paws and a tail.</p>
        <p>Fursuits also provide a physical opportunity to live out furry artistic creations. Advances in animatronics and different structural features allow for a blurring of lines between human body and furry mask. Incorporating articulating jaws to simulate mouth movement, with the structuring of padding, and the utilization of stilts, advancements in fursuits allow for a reinterpretation of realness.</p>
        <p>In conjunction with species performance furry costuming also provides the ability to manipulate one’s visual appearance and act to reflect the gender presentation of their choosing. Within the fandom,gender, species, and identity are all fluid, ever evolving outward representations of how one thinks, feels, and experiences the world around them. This provides furries with the opportunity to create powerful and mystical creatures to escape, empower, and channel one’s frustrations and challenges into physical form.</p>
        <p> Wearing a fursuit around outside others allowd furries to exercise their creativity, playfulness, and connectedness with their character on a much grander scale. The escapist mentality comes into play in these situations, because these interactions provide the opportunity to completely become someone else. The fursuit provides the perfect opportunity to become the being one truly believes themselves to be. This freedom provides those within fursuit a great way to express themselves through far different means than they would in able to in everyday unmasked life. The positive experiences within these situations appear to far outweigh the possibly for negative interactions. Thus, leading to the creation of an entirely seperate entity of personality: The Fursona.</p>
