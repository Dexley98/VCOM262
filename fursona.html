        <h2 id="top">The Fursona</h2>
        <p>One of the most universal behaviors in the furry fandom is the creation of a fursona – an anthropomorphic animal representation or avatar. More than 95% of furries have a fursona. Nearly half of furries report that they have only ever had one fursona to represent themselves. Relatively few furries have had more than three or four fursonas. In part, this is due to the fact that for many furries, their fursonas are a personally significant, meaningful representation of their ideal self. The most popular fursona species include wolves, foxes, dogs, large felines, and dragons.</p>
        <p>Many fursonas are based on 'typical' animal species, such as cats and wolves, but are often only limited by the imaginations of their creator, and can include more extraordinary types of creatures such as aliens, angels, demons, vampires, and mythological creatures. Hybrid fursonas are also popular; furries who like characteristics of more than one animal will combine them into one creature, such as a cat/fox or wolf/raccoon cross. Some give these hybrids portmanteau names, such as "drynx" for a dragon/lynx, or "hedgefox" for a hedgehog/fox.</p>
        <h3>Identity</h3>
        <p>The time when one is first exposed to the furry culutre is quite important to the eventual membership within the fandom. However, the actual act of joining the fandom iss usually observed through the creation of one’s fursona. The fursona acts as the primary source of identification within the fandom and can allow for a variety of presentations of self.</p> 
        <p>Slipping into a fursuit can be catharsis – allowing an otherwise shy and reserved person to transform into someone, or something, else – if only momentarily.</p>
        <p>The creation of multiple fursonas allows for a much broader presentation of self, allowing the individual to explore and represent smaller aspects of their personality that they may not be able to fully express within daily life. The fursona becomes the central component to one’s membership within the furry fandom, while one does not necessarily have to create a fursona to participate within the furry fandom, it is the most symbolic and widely practiced enactment of one’s furry identification. Cultivating one’s fursona takes creativity, passion, and imagination.</p>
