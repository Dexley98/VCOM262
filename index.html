        <p>Welcome to The Den! Established in 2018 our aim to create the ultimate resource for any and every member of the cultural phenomenom that has come to be known as "The Furries". Along with providing the public and the furry community with necessarry information, here at The Den we hope to create a safe space that will shine a positive light on a group of people who have been shamlessly critqued, bashed, and ridiculed by the media and the public. So, get your paws, claws, and hooves wet exploring. </p>
        <p>The furry fandom is a broad term that generally refer to a subculture in which individuals have shown a deeply invested interest in anthropomorphic creatures and artwork. The furry subculture is a well organized and wide ranging phenomenon that traces it's roots to the early 1980s. Most all furries have an interest in the topics of anthropomorphic and zoomorphics. These interests may manifest itself as a hobby or as a central lifestyle aspect that cultivates a(n) identity. No two furries are exactly alike either! For instance, some furries have more of an interest in cartoon animals and comics. Others integrate their animal-focused interets into other parts of their life such as art, writing, and even their sexuality. At the center of the culture is the cultivatation of a “fursona,” which is a unique character that is personified through an anthropomorphic creature exhibiting both human and animal characteristics. Individuals utilize these “fursonas” in a variety of ways, from creating and dispensing artwork, to interacting online within a large internet community, to fabricating and wearing fursuits depicting their characters, and attending conventions throughout the world. </p>
