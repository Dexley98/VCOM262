        <h2 id="top">Interests</h2>
        <p>Many, if not most, furries are connected to the world of technology. Today, those furry fans who have discovered the large concentration of fellow fans on the net have joined with them to create the virtual society that is the collective furry community. They may work as "techs" or be computer or comics "geeks" who have considerable knowledge about anthropomorphism in world mythology, animated Disney films, or Japanese kemono.</p>
        <h3>Forums and Art</h3>
        <p>The Internet contains a multitude of furry websites and online communities, such as art community websites like Fur Affinity and Inkbunny. There are also furry social networking sites like  Furry 4 Life and FurNation.</p>
        <p>The furry community is heavily rooted in the internet. The most common sites for furries to visit are forum based sites such as reddit. However, when furries aren't participating social on the internet, they may be playing neopets or creating new artwork and submitting it to deviant art. A large part of the community thrives on selling their artwork and ideas through these types of sites and have created a sort of furry economy. These sites also serve as meeting grounds for hot topics in the community, and members often finnally get the chance to meet in person at actual conventions.</p>
        <h3>Popular Modern Content</h3>
        <p>Creators of content on the internet do not always create work hoping to create a positve reaction from one particular group. While it is important to understand a demographic and advertise accordingly, many companies opt for a more over-encompassing grab for multiple groups. Sometimes, attention is garned from groups that were not initally targeted. There are a few examples of this type of content that was created without the intention of attracting furries, but are regarded as classics within the subculture.</p>
        <h4>Gaming</h4>
        <p>Web based flash games like neopets and Club Penguin are two notable examples of well liked works in the furry community. Both sites allow you to control anthropomorphic sprites and create a life for them. Neopets focuses more on the upkeep and activites of pets. The now discontinued Club Penguin allowed users to control a penguin avatar that was able to communicate and sociliaze with others in a kid-friendly and fun sub-artic environment.</p>
        <p>Other tyepes of games that are commonly enjoyed by furries are lenghty JRPGs and anthropomorphic works. Since gaming is such a diverse and open community, anthropomorphic characters are not commonly a defining trait for a game to be accepted by the fandom, but artwork and non-cannoical writing exist that link the subculture to the games.</p>

        <h4>Movies and TV</h4>
        <p>Disney has the reputation among furries as one of the most furry friendly companies in the modern era. Their animation often focuses on anthropomorphic characters facing adult problems while remaining skinned as kid friendly. Thus, the company garners a lot of attention from the subculture and is often awarded  some of the highest distinctions possible in the culture at the annual URSA Major Awards.</p>
        <p>I "pet" you'll like these movies even if you aren't a furry!</p>

            <li>Zootopia</li>
            <li>Bambi</li>
            <li>The Lion King</li>

            <li>Isle of Dogs</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Impacts of Media on Society</h3>
        <p>This exposure of the community on almost every media outlet and the increased media coverage of the fandom have been better at spreading the word of the culutre than the group itself. Even if a potential furry does not have access to the internet, intrest can still be gained from consumption of any type of media outside of the internet. So, while the community finds its root and largest prescene online Furries have done an "pawsome" job of breaking down social barriers and consturcts.</p>
