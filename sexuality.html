        <h2 id="top">Reception of Furry Culture</h2>        
        <p>As a subculture, the furry fandom is a stigmatized social subgroup. Multiple media portrayals of the furry community have solidified a deviant stereotyped label for the fandom, which has been difficult to completely overcome. Those within the furry community have had to learn new ways to combat negative interpretations andstereotypes.</p>
        <h3>Sexualization of Culture</h3>
        <p>Mainstream culture and media sources tend to portray furries and the furry fandom in a negative light. Television shows such as CSI, My Strange Addiction, and True Life have all presented furries as deviants who are predominantly interested in the fandom for sexually explicit reasons. While some individuals have openly acknowledged their interests in the sexual aspects of the furry community, a majority of individuals claim this is not their primary intent. Moreover, current research around the furry fandom is quite limited and has rarely been acknowledged within mainstream scientific journals. Due to this lack of acknowledgement, furry voices are effectively lost and marginalized, which reduces the likelihood that this subculture will experience acceptance from mainstream society.</p>
        <p>While the furry fandom has existed since the 1980’s, it was not until the late 1990’s and early 2000’s that it was recognized within the larger mainstream media. The stigmatization of the fandom is mostly credited to a few key events/portrayals of the furry fandom within mainstream media. These images introduced and calcified asexually deviant label onto the furry body and subculture.</p>
        <p>In March 2001, Vanity Fair published an article about the furry fandom entitled “Pleasures of the Fur.” This article further promoted the sexual stereotype of the furry fandom and went into explicit detail about what some individuals did at conventions. Citing terms such as “yiffing,” “scritching,” and “yiff piles,” which were primarily focused around sexual acts committed while in a fursuit. The article tagline was “It’s sex, it’s religion, it’s a whole new way of life”.</p>
        <p>Following the Vanity Fair article, the now infamous, CSI: Crime SceneI nvestigation show aired a furry based episode in their fourth season in 2003. The episode follows the main detectives as they investigate the murder of an individual who also happened to be a furry. The episode unfolds as a strange journey into a world filled with sexual orgies and fetishes, all while characters wore fursuits.</p>
        <p> The fursuited body is seen as deviant, even though it is not breaking any formal laws. It is the physical act of being different and manifesting this difference through outward dress that is labeled and seen as deviant. Typically, those outside of the furry community first encountered the furry identity through extremely stereotyped images of the fandom portrayed in the media, such as the Vanity Fair article or the CSI episode. With these perverse oversimplifications of the fandom at the forefront of many people’s minds, it can be extremely difficult for furries to divulge their identities to those not associated with the fandom.</p>
        <h3>Coping Through Community</h3>
        <p>The furry community provides the opportunity to escape from the daily struggles of life and have fun and fellowship with similar Individuals. It is a vacation from reality and a chance to explore and experience aspects of one’s own personality, created or ascribed, inan attempt to find more fulfillment out of life and all it has to offer. While the stigmatization of the fandom and some of the negative experiences felt can impact one’sday, the commitment to the furry identity and the friends found within the community help mediate the stresses and strains associated with the furry identity.</p>
