        <h2 id="top">We've Come a "Fur" Way</h2>
        <p>Throughout the decades, the furry fandom has grown exponentially, primarily due to the internet. While the internet is a key facet of the fandom, it is not the only focal point that has contributed greatly to the furry culture today. Conventions, fur meets, and the furry economy (fursuits, artwork, etc.) all play vital parts within the makeup of the fandom (“Furry fandom,” n.d.). The furry fandom is a multifacetedi nterconnected group of people all united under a key interest in anthropomorphic animals.</p>
        <h3>Cartoons</h3>
        <p>The creation and establishment of the furry fandom is largely attributed to a few key individuals, events, and organizations throughout the early to mid 1980’s. However, when beginning the chronological mappings of the furry fandom, it is important to acknowledge how prevalent anthropomorphic characters have been throughout the decades preceding the furry community. A multitude of works, such as those by Lewis Carroll (Alice in Wonderland) and C.S. Lewis (Chronicles of Narnia) provided vivid and popular images of anthropomorphic characters. Television shows and movies, such as The Looney Toons or Disney’s Robin Hood, provided yet another visual embodiment of these anthropomorphic creatures.</p>
        <p>While the furry fandom did not get its named start until the 1980’s, many individuals who first established the fandom have traced their initial interests and fellowship with like minded people as far back as the 1960s. Groups of teenagers and college aged individuals would get together to watch different cartoon television shows or movies that interested them. It is from these common friendly meetings, that a few individuals in Los Angeles in 1977 would come to establish a club solely devoted to their love of anime named the The Cartoon/Fantasy Organization.</p>
        <h3>Early Internet Roots</h3>
        <p>MUCKs, or multi-user chat kingdoms are a text based system for communication and somtimes gaming. Mucks are primarily made up of role-play, social interaction centric virtual text-based worlds. FurryMUCK was launched on North Carolina State University servers through TinyMUCk in 1990, by a group of computer science majors and continues to be the longest running MUCK to date. FurryMUCK allowed users to directly interact with each other, creating anthropomorphic characters and new worlds all with a few strokes on a key board.</p>
        <h3>Conventions</h3>
        <p>With a larger group of people looking for furry artwork and publications, the decision for a more specialized convention came in 1989. Mark Merlino started the first furry centric convention known as ConFURence. It took place in 1989 in a Holiday Inn in Costa Mesa, California. The initial dry run convention, aptly named ConFURence Zero, had an attendance of only 65 people. Each year after, the convention continued to grow, with maximum attendance at the 1998 convention with 1,200 attendees.</p>
