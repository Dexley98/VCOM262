        <h2 id="top">Similar Groups</h2>
        <p>The furry community relies on a few concepts that have other interpretations and usages besides the furry lifestyle. Most notably, anthropomorphism is the driving concept the culture is based on. An example of a group that has a drastically different interpratation of this concept is the religion of Otherkin.</p>
        <h3>What is Anthropomorphism?</h3>
        <p>Anthropomorphism is the attribution of human traits, emotions, or intentions to non-human entities. It is considered to be an innate tendency of human psychology. Personification is the related attribution of human form and characteristics to abstract concepts such as nations, emotions, and natural forces, such as seasons and weather. Both have ancient roots as storytelling and artistic devices, and most cultures have traditional fables with anthropomorphized animals as characters. People have also routinely attributed human emotions and behavioural traits to wild and domesticated animals.</p>
        <p>Other examples of anthropomorphism include the attribution of human traits to animals, especially domesticated pets such as dogs and cats. Examples of this include thinking a dog is smiling simply because he is showing his teeth, or a cat is bored because it is not reacting to commands. Anthropomorphism may be beneficial to the welfare of animals. Utilizing anthropomorphic language when describing dogs created a greater willingness to help them in situations of distress. Previous studies have shown that individuals who attribute human characteristics to animals are less willing to eat them and that the degree to which individuals perceive minds in other animals predicts the moral concern afforded to them. It is possible that anthropomorphism leads humans to like non-humans more when they have apparent human qualities, since perceived similarity has been shown to increase prosocial behavior toward other humans.</p>
        <h3>Who are the Otherkin?</h3>
        <p>Otherkin largely identify as mythical creatures, with others identifying as creatures from fantasy or popular culture. Examples include: angels, demons, dragons, goats, elves, fairies, sprites, aliens, and cartoon characters. Many Otherkin believe in the existence of a multitude of parallel universes, and their belief in the existence of supernatural or sapient non-human beings is grounded in that idea. With regard to their online communities, Otherkin largely function without formal authority structures, and mostly focus on support and information gathering, often dividing into more specific groups based on kintype. There are occasional offline gatherings, but the otherkin network is mostly an online phenomenon. Some otherkin claim to be especially empathic and attuned to nature. Some state to be able to shapeshift mentally or astrally, meaning that they experience the sense of being in their particular form while not actually changing physically.</p>
        <p>The most notable difference between the creation of the fursona and the practice of the relgion of Otherkin is that those who practice Otherkin sometimes modify their actual physical apperance with surgical implants instead of the alternative of a "mask" mentality like a fursuit.</p>
